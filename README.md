Another x86_64 userland rootkit for Linux.

Like in real life, Mao took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/mephistolist/hoxha">Hoxha</a>. While his style differed from <a href="https://github.com/mephistolist/tito">Tito</a>, they both integrated elements of Capitalism into their economies. At the same time, Mao had his own theory and legacy. For this reason you may find elements of the two previously mentioned projects, but a great deal of improvements and changes. Better mutation, anti-forensics and better hiding on the system. Again, I will probably hold off on going in-depth on this project until after it publication.
